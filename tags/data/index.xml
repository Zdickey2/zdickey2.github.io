      <description>In this blog I am going to be looking at the last Premier League Season without any stoppage/controversy and look at which team/teams were the best and worst at home and away matches. The 2018-2019 Premier League season came down to the last game of the season with Manchester City needing a victory to win the title, which they did on Matchday 38. My personal favorite team Liverpool lost only one game and did not win, so I wanted to see if the table results actually truly represents which teams preformed the best.</description>
